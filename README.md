# Gymnasium-Coding_for_Designers
This is a workshop that I took to gain a better understanding about HTML and CSS. The workshop provided  6 lessons and a final exam to test your knowledge and skills. This repository documents my work and journey in obtaining the Coding for Design certification by Gymnasium.

**NOTE:** At the time of using this repo, I did not have good working knowledge on GitHub and Git as I do today. Therefore, the workflow presented within this repository may not follow best practices.
