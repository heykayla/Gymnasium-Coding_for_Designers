# Gymnasium-Coding_for_Designers
This is a workshop that I took to gain a better understanding about HTML and CSS. The workshop provided  6 lessons and a final exam to test your knowledge and skills. This repository will be documenting my work and journey in obtaining the Coding for Design certification by Gymnasium.
